# Heelaert | Detection & Alert of “Equinus Gait” Anomaly for CP Children

Equinus gait is a condition cerebral palsy (CP) kids suffers from, which results in toe-walking.   
For children, practicing properly walking without supervision can be difficult and their inattention
can harm their progress up to surgical involvement.
Our main goal was to develop a device that will be mostly reliable and alert accordingly, yet be light,
cheap, comfortable, and durable for any common situation.
  
By sampling different kids from Alyn Hospital with Equinus gait, we were able to discover a pattern of 
the leg movement, distinguish if the walk sequence was correct or not and alert the kid (and his therapist/parent) by sound signal.

The system contains three essential parts: Measuring the feet and ankle movement and angle was done 
by an accelerometer and pressure sensor sampled at 250Hz.  Analysing the data and alert was done by
Arduino NANO. All the components chosen to be low weight and low power (minimize battery size) to minimize 
the influence on the kid natural walking.
